# snappy-win-build

snappy Windows build with Visual Studio.

This version is an up-to-date fork of google/snappy.

To build, simply open the required solution file, and
you know how to use Visual Studio, right?
(or perhaps this is the wrong place for you.)

Additional changes:

* DLL support.

* Fixed a bunch of integer type size mismatches.

* Applied some static_cast to reduce compiler warnings.
